on BlockstackGuillermo Villanueva, 

the CEO of Extrimian and co-founder of Grupo Sabra,
told Cointelegraph that the focus of the initiative differs from existing offerings:-

    “There are many Blockchain-as-a-Service offers, but they focus on solving the problem of deploying permissioned networks. Our vision is that the key problem to solve is the connection and integration of the systems that the Enterprise already has to these new technologies.”
